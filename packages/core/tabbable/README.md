# tabbable

The `tabbable` package is no longer maintained. Its owner, David Clark, invited me (Chance) as a new
maintainer but has thus far not published any updates since then. It's still a mostly good package
but there will be some minor adjustments likely needed in the future considering that it depends
largely on browser implementations that will change over time. It's a simple enough package to fork
and maintain internally IMO.
